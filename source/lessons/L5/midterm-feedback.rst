Summary of mid-term course feedback
===================================

1. Is the pace of the lessons too fast, too slow, or about right?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- Seems to be about right on average. A bit slow for some (with experience), a bit too fast for others (new coders)
- Would be good in a normal classroom, but can be hard to keep up remotely when you have the notebooks in another tab
- 3 hours is a long time and some material could be left out of the lessons as material to read independently

2. Is the content of the lessons too simple, too difficult, or about right?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Very similar to last year*

- Seems to be about right for many
- Students with earlier programming experience feel its a bit simple
- Some topics have been more challenging than others
- Lessons are made far too difficult due to poor teaching skills :(
- 

3. Is the content of the exercises too simple, too difficult, or about right?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- About right for many
- A bit challenging for some and time consuming
- Optional extra problems would be nice, such as making the flag
- Exercises are considerably harder than the lesson material
- Some things have not been properly taught in the lessons
- Would be easier if the course infrastructure was clear

4. Which aspect(s) of the course is/are most helpful to you?
------------------------------------------------------------

- Exercises
- Pair programming (!)
- Lesson materials online
- Course website
- Step-by-step instructions
- Interactive questions in class
- Lecture videos (uploaded right after class, if possible)
- Working on real-life tasks

5. Which aspect(s) of the course is/are least helpful to you?
-------------------------------------------------------------

- Zoom exercise sessions
- Working in pairs
- Not being able to save things with Binder (any solutions?)
- Too many platforms/services/sites

6. What suggestions do you have for improving this course? Comments related to online teaching would be especially useful!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Make pair programming optional
- More detail in exercise instructions
- Cut videos into smaller pieces
- Include time to start on the exercises during class
- Videos could be up sooner
- Would be good to have more info about what you can do with Python
- Extra exercise problems!
- More interactivity
- Faster feedback

7. Do you have any other general comments about the course?
-----------------------------------------------------------

- *Many positive comments, thanks!*
